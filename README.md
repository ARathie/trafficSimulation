# trafficSimulation

# 1: Open a terminal and navigate to the working directory containing the project files.
# 2: Run python3 mainWorld.py to run the simulation. The following will detail the parameters:
# command format: 
  # python3 mainWorld.py (mode) (delay) (start time) (end time) (speed limit) (pedestrian) (light time)
  # mode: if 1: print stuff for user to see, if 2: collect data
  # delay: should be 0 by default, some number if modeling uncoordinated system
  # start time: the start time
  # end time: the end time
  # speed limit: the speed limit
  # pedestrian: false by default, true if want to model pedestrians
  # light time: how long will lights be lit
# 3: View the printed output for some stats.
